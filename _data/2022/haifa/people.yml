    - name: Pavel Goldstein
      bio: "Pavel Goldstein is the Head of Integrative Pain (iPain) Laboratory, Head of MPH Biostatistics track at the School of Public Health, Social Welfare & Health Sciences Faculty, The University of Haifa.Pavel has completed Master's in Biostatistics and Ph.D. in Pain Neuroscience. In 2019 he founded the Integrative Pain Laboratory at the University of Haifa to gather a novel understanding of chronic pain conditions, developing new ways of measuring, preventing, and treating chronic pain. Pavel's research is essential for more than pure knowledge. Ultimately, his future research is driven by the need to integrate the academy and the industry. Providing data science consultations for medical device companies, academic researchers from multiple fields, and doctors, helped him to acquire a “common ground” between academic investigators, business representatives, and healthcare providers. When all parties see the advantage of combining the industrial drive to ‘get things done’ with clinical insights and the academic urge to ‘understand how it works’, the final outcomes improve significantly."
